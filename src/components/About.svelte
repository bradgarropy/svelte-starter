<h1>ðŸ¤– cybernetically enhanced svelte starter</h1>

<p>
    Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas
    traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the
    browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you
    build your app.

<p>
    Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code
    that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.
